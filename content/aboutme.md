# Hey, I'm Darshan  

I’m a **Software Engineer** based in Bengaluru, India. I currently work at [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/) on **Cross Data Center Replication** ([goxdcr](https://github.com/couchbase/goxdcr)) and also contribute to the backend of our cloud product, [Capella](https://www.couchbase.com/products/capella/). I’ve been part of Couchbase since **January 2024**.  

Beyond work, I enjoy coding for fun—mostly in **C++** and **Go**—and I’ve also explored languages like **Python** and **Java**. My passion lies in **systems programming**, and I’m particularly enthusiastic about **distributed systems** and **cloud technologies**. Most of my work can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/darshan-na).  

Outside of tech, I try to stay active and am currently aiming to run **five days a week**. Earlier, I used to **speed skate** and even participated in **state-level championships**.
